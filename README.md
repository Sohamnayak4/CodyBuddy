## CodyBuddy – Competitive Programming Dashboard

**CodyBuddy** is a full-stack web application that lets you **aggregate and track your competitive-programming progress** across multiple platforms – Codeforces, LeetCode and CodeChef – in one place.  
Users can:

* Create an account or sign in via JWT-based authentication.
* Connect their individual handles for each supported platform.
* View a personalised dashboard with rating history, solved-problem stats and latest contest results.
* Manage their profile details straight from the UI (update or permanently delete the account).

The app is built with **Next.js (App Router)** on the frontend and lightweight REST endpoints (under `/api/*`) on the backend, backed by **MongoDB** for persistence.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
